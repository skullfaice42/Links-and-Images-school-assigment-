<H2>How do Images work?</H2>
<p>Its pretty simple, all you really have to do is 
    first have the image you want added, then add it using the < img > tag then scr 
    right after <br> (< img src >) <----- that is what the code looks like in HTML
<br>
Heres the link for what a Dango is. (Below)

<h2>How do Gif's work</h2>
<p>Like images, Gif's work in a similar way, just like images, they also work using
    (< img src >) <br> </p>

<h2>How do use hyper links?</h2>

<p>
Its not very hard to use a hyper link... for example all you 
have to do is add the < a > tag as well as href right after it, 
so it would look something like this (< a href="url goes here" >What you 
want your link to be seen as< /a >)
